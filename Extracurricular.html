	<p style = "font-size:25px">I played a ton of basketball for the school team, as well as some on my own. I've been playing basketball for nearly half my life now, and I really like playing and I love the team atmosphere.</p>

           <p style = "font-size:25px">Over the last year or so my friends and I got into rock climbing, and started to go a few times a week. One of my friends was really good, and it is just a really good atmosphere at the gym, and all sorts of fun routes to try. Unfortunately we haven't been able to go recently, but we will hopefuly start again next year.</p>
